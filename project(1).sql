The chromosome shares large regions of synteny with the chromosomes of three environmental Arthrobacter strains for which genome sequences are available: A. aurescens TC1, A. chlorophenolicus A6 and Arthrobacter sp.

These include the ability to catabolize D-galactonate, a high number of glycine betaine and related osmolyte transporters, two siderophore biosynthesis gene clusters and a high number of Fe(3+)/siderophore transport systems. In model cheese experiments, addition of small amounts of iron strongly stimulated the growth of A. arilaitensis, indicating that cheese is a highly iron-restricted medium.

DNA-DNA hybridization with the type strains of all recognized Acetobacter species revealed DNA-DNA relatedness values below the species level. The DNA G+C contents of three selected strains were 56.9-57.3 mol%. The novel strains had phenotypic characteristics that enabled them to be differentiated from phylogenetically related Acetobacter species, i.e. they were motile, did not produce 2-ketogluconic acid or 5-ketogluconic acid from glucose, were catalase-positive and oxidase-negative, grew on yeast extract with 30 % glucose, grew on glycerol (although weakly) but not on maltose or methanol as carbon sources, and did not grow with ammonium as sole nitrogen source and ethanol as carbon source. Based on the genotypic and phenotypic data, the isolates represent a novel species of the genus Acetobacter for which the name Acetobacter ghanensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is R-29337(T) (=430A(T)=LMG 23848(T)=DSM 18895(T)). ', '17625210'),

These cultures are generally designed to meet food safety, shelf-life, technological effectiveness and economic feasibility criteria. Besides all these traditional properties, novel starter cultures should take into account the risks posed by the formation of biogenic amines in food, and the development and spreading of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Further, \'functional starters\' could protect consumers from harmful bacteria either by a rapid acidification or by the production of antimicrobials (bacteriocins). Specially-selected cultures may also provide probiotic benefits, and, if properly modified, they may even be endorsed with nutraceutical traits. The present review discusses the technological and new selection criteria that should be taken into account when selecting LAB starter cultures for the production of fermented dry sausages.', '22064200'),

However, it is still unclear whether two distinct groups of beneficial bacteria, non-plant-associated (soil) strains and plant-associated (endophytic) strains, respond uniformly or variably to the exposure with root exudates. Therefore, Bacillus mycoides, a potential biocontrol agent and plant growth-promoting bacterium, was isolated from the endosphere of potatoes and from soil of the same geographical region. Confocal fluorescence microscopy of plants inoculated with GFP-tagged B. mycoides strains showed that the endosphere isolate EC18 had a stronger plant colonization ability and competed more successfully for the colonization sites than the soil isolate SB8. To dissect these phenotypic differences, the genomes of the two strains were sequenced and the transcriptome response to potato root exudates was compared. The global transcriptome profiles evidenced that the endophytic isolate responded more pronounced than the soil-derived isolate and a higher number of significant differentially expressed genes were detected. Both isolates responded with the alteration of expression of an overlapping set of genes, which had previously been reported to be involved in plant–microbe interactions; including organic substance metabolism, oxidative reduction, and transmembrane transport. Notably, several genes were specifically upregulated in the endosphere isolate EC18, while being oppositely downregulated in the soil isolate SB8. These genes mainly encoded membrane proteins, transcriptional regulators or were involved in amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis. By contrast, several genes upregulated in the soil isolate SB8 and downregulated in the endosphere isolate EC18 were related to sugar transport, which might coincide with the different nutrient availability in the two environments. Altogether, the presented transcriptome profiles provide highly improved insights into the life strategies of plant-associated endophytes and soil isolates of B. mycoides.', '28824604'),

Bacteria are the most dominant group of this diversity which produce a wide range of products of industrial significance. Paenibacillus polymyxa (formerly Bacillus polymyxa), a non pathogenic and endospore-forming Bacillus, is one of the most industrially significant facultative anaerobic bacterium. It occurs naturally in soil, rhizosphere and roots of crop plants and in marine sediments. During the last two decades, there has been a growing interest for their ecological and biotechnological importance, despite their limited genomic information. P. polymyxa has a wide range of properties, including nitrogen fixation, plant growth promotion, soil phosphorus solubilisation and production of exopolysaccharides, hydrolytic enzymes, antibiotics, cytokinin. It also helps in bioflocculation and in the enhancement of soil porosity. In addition, it is known to produce optically active 2,3-butanediol (BDL), a potentially valuable chemical compound from a variety of carbohydrates. The present review article aims to provide an overview of the various roles that these microorganisms play in the environment and their biotechnological potential.', '23100748'),

To evaluate whether the free-living soil bacterium, Paenibacillus polymyxa, releases the hormone group cytokinins and, if so, their identity, the content of cytokinins in the growth media, before and after cultivation of this bacterium, was determined by immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC). This method allows the isolation of almost all known cytokinins and their metabolites. Separation and characterization were done by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with on-line ultraviolet (UV) detection, and final identification was by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Iso-pentenyladenine (iP) was identified in the two defined media used for the cultivation of P. polymyxa, but not earlier than at its late stationary growth. A third medium, supplemented with yeast extract, contained iso-pentenyladenine riboside (iPR) and some additional cytokinin-like substances before inoculation. When the same medium was sampled after the cultivation of P. polymyxa up to its logarithmic growth phase, the cytokinin concentration had decreased. After prolonged cultivation of P. polymyxa, small amounts of iP appeared in all three media, and iPR had disappeared from the yeast-containing medium, which indicates that the bacterium can metabolize cytokinins.', '--'),

We used samples from a Red soil subject to a long-term chemical and organic fertilization experiment, including control without fertilizer (CK), swine manure (M), chemical fertilization (NPK), and chemical/manure combined fertilization (MNPK) treatment, to explore how agricultural practices impact the community structure, abundance, and potential activity of nitrite oxidizers (PNO). The abundance of Nitrobacter was significantly increased in the M and MNPK plots, whereas the abundance of Nitrospira was significantly reduced in the M and NPK treatment plots and less inhibited in the MNPK treatment. The PNO showed a similar trend to that for Nitrobacter abundance. ', '--'),

The potential for this process to increase agricultural yield while reducing the reliance on nitrogen-based fertilizers has generated interest in understanding and manipulating this process. For decades, rhizobium research has benefited from the use of leading techniques from a very broad set of fields, including population genetics, molecular genetics, genomics, and systems biology. In this review, we summarize many of the research strategies that have been employed in the study of rhizobia and the unique knowledge gained from these diverse tools, with a focus on genome- and systems-level approaches. We then describe ongoing synthetic biology approaches aimed at improving existing symbioses or engineering completely new symbiotic interactions. The review concludes with our perspective of the future directions and challenges of the field, with an emphasis on how the application of a multidisciplinary approach and the development of new methods will be necessary to ensure successful biotechnological manipulation of the symbiosis.

In addition to the structural genes of the enzyme nitrogenase and of other accessory proteins, A. vinelandii chromosomes contain the regulatory genes nifL and nifA. NifA must bind upstream of the promoters of all nif operons for enabling their expression. NifL on activation by oxygen or ammonium, interacts with NifA and neutralizes it. Nitrogen fixation has been enhanced by deletion of nifL and by bringing nifA under the control of a constitutive promoter, resulting in a strain that continues to fix nitrogen in presence of urea fertilizer.', '31495403');
